## About Me

I'm a B.Tech student specializing in **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, focused on building **practical, end-to-end Machine Learning systems**.

I work on real ML problems involving **data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment**.  
I value **clarity, metrics, and reproducibility** over buzzwords.

## Tech Stack

**Languages**  
- Python  

**Machine Learning / Deep Learning**  
- Scikit-learn  
- PyTorch  
- TensorFlow  

**Data & Visualization**  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

**Deployment & Tools**  
- Flask  
- Docker (basic)  
- Git, Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Current Focus

- Building ML models for **classification and regression** problems  
- Applying **feature engineering and evaluation metrics** to improve performance  
- Learning and implementing **deep learning architectures** using PyTorch  
- Developing **deployable ML projects** instead of isolated notebooks

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**, focused on building **practical and reliable ML systems** rather than just theoretical models.

I’ve worked on the **complete ML lifecycle** — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and basic deployment.  
I care about **why a model works**, not just making it run.

**Deep Learning**
- Neural Networks fundamentals
- CNNs for image-based tasks
- Training loops, loss functions, optimizers
- Working with PyTorch & TensorFlow

**Data Handling**
- Data cleaning and transformation using Pandas & NumPy
